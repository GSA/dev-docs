## Contact link

In addition to the links found in the identifier, all GSA websites must include agency-level contact information in the site header or footer. Whenever possible, provide both an email address and a phone number.

- Include a link to `Contacts` or `Contact us` in the header or footer of each web page.
- Treat any email addresses published on the Internet as a business asset, and respond to customer inquiries within a reasonable timeframe (same day when possible, or within no more than three business days).
